In the modified application, process B, shared memory and the second ncurses window are
unchanged. Process A includes two new features:

1. Client connection toward a similar application running on a different machine in the network
2. Server connection for a similar application running on a different machine in the network

Therefore the application, when launched, asks for one execution modality:

1. Normal, as assignment 2

2. Server: The application does not use the keyboard for input: it receives input from another
application (on a different machine) running in client mode.

3. Client: the application runs normally as assignment 2 and sends its keyboard input to another
application (on a different machine) running in server mode.

When selecting modes 2 and 3 the application asks address and port of the companion
application.

Protocol
To assure that any application is able to properly connect to any other application (implemented by
some other student/group), a communication protocol must be defined.
IP protocol: TCP
data: a byte stream of char, one per key pressed.
(flush data if necessary).
